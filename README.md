Welcome! My name is Mauro and this is my project for the 24FAL-CIS-7-28754 class. 

My project is case number 3 and it consists of encrypting and decrypting text using the vigenere cipher. 
This is a method that uses polyalphabetic substitution. In a general and simple way, this cipher works by 
setting a text and a key. The key will be repeated until the characters of the text are equal and then the 
letters will be added together to obtain a number that will fit in a range of 26 numbers (letters of the al
phabet), thus obtaining a new word. The process is reversed when decrypting a message, also making use of a
text (already encrypted) and a key (the same with which it was encrypted).
